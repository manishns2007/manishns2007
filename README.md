🧑‍💼 Professional Summary

Cybersecurity-oriented software developer with a strong foundation in secure systems, AI-assisted engineering, and low-level computing concepts.
I focus on understanding how systems break, identifying vulnerabilities, and building robust, security-first software.

I enjoy working close to the system — from Linux internals to secure web backends — and using AI as a tool for engineering productivity, not a crutch.

⚡ Personal Note
Security is not a feature — it is the foundation.
